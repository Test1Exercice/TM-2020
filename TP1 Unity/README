# Practical Work Proposals 1 (TP1 Unity)

For this TP1, the goal is to create a unique game in Unity, with your creativity and
your knowledge where you can use all the assets of the unity store, that way you can
have a more complete and attractive game.
You are free to think and do any type of game you want, 2D or 3D, as long as you
use unity, a car game, a platform game, or i suggest, a fps game as we will have
some exercises in classes.


## Example:

### FPS game
* Create a game based in the FPS Microgame, taking some effort to create
yours objectives and your levels to create something unique, new enemies
new levels, new weapons. The idea is, just to use the base and the core
functionalities provided in the tutorial FPS Microgame, to make a new unique
game. Be creative and ambitious!
